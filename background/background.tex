\section{Magnetism and matter}

\subsection{Fundamentals of magnetism}

The description of magnetic fields is analogue to that of electrical fields. Although, unlike the situation in electricity, there are no magnetic charges, only magnetic dipoles. A more thorough analysis reveals the origin of magnetism is electrical: a circular electrical current (either a flow of electrons or a single electron) produces an \textit{induction} field $\vec{B}$. As such, the SI magnetic units are represented by electrical and mechanical units. Thus, on a fundamental level it is correct to understand magnetism as an electrical phenomenon.\par
